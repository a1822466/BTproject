# Project Info
This project will not be functional unless the user has installed the public BehaviourTree.cpp C++ library by Davide Faconti onto their computer, as well as the Webots simulator to run the simulation.

The user should open the BTandHuman.wbt world file for the finished product of a user-controlled and BT-controlled robot working together, or the onehuman.wbt file for the user-controlled robot only.

The BT robot should be using the ObjectYoubot.cpp file as its controller, and the user controlled robot should use the YoubotTeleoperation.cpp file as its controller.
